There are lot of new programmers entering the field this year, here are somethings I think will help stand out.

## Podcasts
Podcast are a great way to passively learn about programming and what is out there. If you have

## Meetups
Meetups are a great way to find out who is hiring in the technology you are learning and also find out more about the thing you are learning to do. Start by searching to see if there are any interesting Web/Technology based meetups in your area.

## Extra Reading
Staying up to date with industry changes or identifying trends is hard, but signing up to mailing lists is easy. I recommend the following lists to get started.

- [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
- [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)
- [New Programmers Mailing List](https://bootcamping.curated.co/)

## Blog Templates
[My blog](http://theblackc000000de.blogspot.com/) was the thing I invested time into. I received a number interview requests and opportunities because of it, I recommend starting a blog yesterday about what you are doing and commit to writing on it eveyr week.
